## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-20

First working release: local, resumable CLI for overnight dashcam /
security-camera footage analysis on Apple Silicon, with the full
cheap-first pipeline (dedup → CV prefilter → local LLM triage → detail).

### Added

- **Core pipeline**: single ffmpeg decode pass with motion + dHash +
  MOG2 dedup gate, OSD timestamp masking, CLAHE night/IR enhancement;
  YOLO + ByteTrack vehicle tracking with weaving/direction analysis;
  per-track license-plate crops OCR'd via Apple Vision (accurate mode)
  with cross-frame consensus voting; scene-text capture (1/30s) in FTS5;
  person/motion/time-of-day threat scoring (intrusion, loitering,
  suspicious_behavior); audio analysis with mlx-whisper, Silero VAD and
  RMS loudness (transcripts, loud regions, distress keywords).
- **LLM passes**: Ollama triage (gemma3:4b, single keyframe, drops
  irrelevant events) and detail (gemma4:12b, multi-keyframe with tile
  escalation), JSON-repair retries, model digests recorded per result.
- **Batch engine**: serialized claim/lease job processing, crash-safe
  resume (`--resume`), stale-job reclaim, dead-letter after 3 attempts,
  time budgets (`--stop-after`), LLM event budget breaker, retention
  pruning, disk preflight + runtime watermark, caffeinate + AC-power
  guards, signal-safe shutdown.
- **Source adapters**: `mazda_cx8` (camera-local filename timestamps →
  UTC, front/rear pairing, mode→priority, NMEA `$GPRMC`/`$GSENS`
  sidecars → `clip_gps_data` plus `hard_brake`/`hard_corner`/`impact`
  events at zero vision cost), `gopro`, `generic`; auto-detection from
  directory layout.
- **`vs import`**: card-swap workflow — scans live cards or date-wrapped
  archives, dedups by content hash (incremental), atomic verified copy
  to `artifact_dir/clips/<date>/<mode>/<channel>/`, registers jobs with
  import ids, sessions and clip metadata; NMEA sidecars travel with
  their clips.
- **Reports + search**: per-job HTML report (timeline, keyframes,
  plates, transcript, GPS/driving log); `vs search` across FTS5 text,
  plates and dangerous-driving kinds.
- **Installer** (`install.sh`): self-contained install to
  `~/.local/opt/video-security` (phototext pattern) — venv snapshot,
  `var/config.toml` bound to the configured artifact dir, catalog
  migrated from `~/.video-security`, PATH wrappers for every entry
  point plus a `vs-dev` workspace wrapper; `--uninstall [--purge]`,
  upgrade by re-running.
- **Tests + benchmarks**: 180 tests including a deterministic golden
  clip (moving bus + person + readable plate), mock Ollama server, and
  throughput benchmarks with floors (decode, YOLO, full prefilter).

### Fixed

- dHash values overflowed SQLite's signed 64-bit integers on real
  footage (~50% of frames); now stored as signed ints, losslessly.
- Real Ollama integration: model digests come from `/api/tags` (the
  client's GET `/api/show` returned 405), and failed-job retries now
  wipe partial rows first instead of hitting unique-constraint errors.
- Mazda NMEA parsing: real `$GSENS` lines carry no NMEA checksum and
  were silently dropped; checksum-less sentences are now accepted.
